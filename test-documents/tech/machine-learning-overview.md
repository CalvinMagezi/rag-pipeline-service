# Machine Learning and AI: A Comprehensive Overview

## Introduction

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can automatically learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.

**Classification**: Predicting discrete categories
- Examples: Email spam detection, image recognition, medical diagnosis
- Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks

**Regression**: Predicting continuous values
- Examples: Stock price prediction, house price estimation, sales forecasting
- Algorithms: Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Ridge/Lasso Regression

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples.

**Clustering**: Grouping similar data points
- Examples: Customer segmentation, gene sequencing, recommendation systems
- Algorithms: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN

**Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing the number of features while preserving information
- Examples: Data visualization, feature selection, noise reduction
- Algorithms: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-SNE, UMAP

### Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning learns through interaction with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties.
- Examples: Game playing (AlphaGo), robotics, autonomous vehicles
- Algorithms: Q-Learning, Policy Gradient, Actor-Critic

## Deep Learning
